# Pandas: Heroes of Pymoli

 Pandas and Jupyter Notebook were used to analyze the data for a fantasy game called Heroes of Pymoli. The game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. The project includes a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights by purchasing behaviors by player demographics.
