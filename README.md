# Pandas: Heroes of Pymoli

The goal of this project is to use Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to analyze the data for a fantasy game called Heroes of Pymoli. The game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. The overall goal is to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights by purchasing behaviors by player demographics.

[Analysis done, just need to double check everything one more time before submission]
